AutoHR is a Property Management Solution for US Army units, primarily at echelon of battalion and below.  

Users are able to upload primary Hand receipts to populate a database, then handle exchange of property between users using the site's interface.  

Primary audience is company executive officers and staff primaries, who are responsible for a lot of equipment and sign items out frequently.  AutoHR is meant to represent a single source of truth for property exchanges, locations, and maintenance status. 

Currently working to implement calendar view for signed out equipment and generation of DA Forms 2062 automatically based on the exchange on the postgres database.
